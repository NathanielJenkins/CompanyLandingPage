      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 1st 2022</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the SteepDeep website (the "Site"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these
          Terms of Use (the "Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Site. We may update
          these Terms from time to time, and your continued use of the Site constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Use of the Site</h2>
        <p>The Site is intended as an exploratory tool for learning about resort facilities, including runs, trails, and
          amenities. It is not designed to determine the precise location or existance of any geographical features, as
          the
          information provided may not be accurate. The Site does not offer
          real-time or precise geographic data about mountain terrain and should not be relied upon for navigation or
          assessing the safety of terrain. Information about trail statuses, including open or closed trails, may be
          inaccurate or outdated. Users must refer to the resort's on-site signage and staff for accurate and
          current information regarding trail conditions and other geographical features. Guests should refer to
          on-mountain signage for navigation and trail statuses, regarless of the information posted on the site.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, the Site relies on external data
          to drive run statuses including difficulty, open-closed and groomed. This data may be inaccurate or
          out-of-date, and SteepDeep does
          not take responsibility for any inaccuracies or outdated information. Users should always adhere to the rules
          and signage of the resort they are on, rather than referring to this digital tool. The Site offers estimates
          and may not reflect true reality. Actual locations of trails, runs, amenities and all geo-graphical features
          may vary.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>4. In-Resort Information and Rules</h2>
        <p>Guests should always refer to in-resort signage for accurate navigation, difficulty ratings, and
          information about closures and hazards. The Site is not a substitute for on-resort information. Users must
          adhere to all posted closures, warnings, and rules at the resort, regardless of what the map indicates. Any
          changes to the status of trails, runs, or areas at the resort are determined by the resort’s terms of use and
          not by the Site.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Dangers and Hazardous Terrain</h2>
        <p>The Site does not reflect or represent any potential dangers present on the mountain, including but not
          limited to hazardous terrain, cliffs, or other natural obstacles. These dangers are not shown on the map and
          are not be accurately depicted. Hazardous terrain may exist on trails or areas outlined on the map, as the
          locations and conditions depicted (section 7) may not be accurate. The Site is intended for digital
          exploratory purposes only and
          should never be used to assess or navigate dangerous terrain. It is the user’s sole responsibility to be aware
          of and avoid such hazards. Users must exercise caution and adhere to all safety guidelines and warnings
          provided by the resort to ensure their safety. SteepDeep disclaims any liability for injuries, damages, or
          losses resulting from the failure to recognize or avoid hazardous conditions, including those that may exist
          on trails or areas depicted on the Site but not accurately represented.</p>
